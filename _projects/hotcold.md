As mentioned in [Classical Heat Engines](/_projects/classical.md), a heat engine converts
heat into work. A simple heat engine interacts with a hot environment,
also called a cold reservoir or cold bath, and a hot environment. Heat
flows naturally from the hot reservoir to the cold. The engine extracts
some of that heat and converts it into work. In the sculpture, the blue
tank represents the cold reservoir, and the red tank represents the hot.
The blue and red tubes illustrate the enginesâ€™ connections to the
reservoirs.
