We usually think of an engine as formed from many interlocking components. But one atom can form an engine, if it converts heat into work. The sculpture depicts an engine formed from an ion (electrically charged atom). The engine was inspired by an experiment but also reflects artistic license. The experiment is reported on in a paper published [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad6320) and available for free to all [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03681). The amber light at the sculptureâ€™s center represents the ion. Many experimentalists and engineers use ions to record information in quantum computers.
