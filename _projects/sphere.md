A sphere encloses most of the sculpture. Aesthetically, the sphere evokes an _armillary_ sphere, a representation of astronomical information. Armillary spheres were invented centuries ago, and they appear in artwork evocative of earlier eras, such as steampunk art and its relative clockpunk art. In addition to providing an old-world vibe, this sculptureâ€™s sphere evokes the _Bloch sphere_, described in [the Arrow](/_projects/arrow.md).
