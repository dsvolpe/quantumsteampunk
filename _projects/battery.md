What would you do with the work extracted by an engine? You could power a refrigerator, turn a wheel, induce a chemical reaction, or perform another task that requires reliable energy. Alternatively, you could store the energy in a battery for later. A depiction of a battery appears near the top of the sculpture. (The depiction is intended to be suggestive in this artist rendering; you might not want to hook a quantum engine up to a classical battery.)
