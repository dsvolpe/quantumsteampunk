Four classical heat engines are distributed around the sculpture’s base.

A _heat engine_ is a device that converts heat into work. _Heat_ is the uncoordinated energy of particles wiggling about randomly. _Work_ is coordinated energy that one can harness directly to perform a useful task such as charging a battery. In this artist rendition, the sculpture’s classical engines power the lasers that cool and otherwise serve the quantum engine described below.
