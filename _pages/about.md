WThe Quantadrive is an interactive, kinetic sculpture being shared across the world through travel and social media. The sculpture combines the whimsy of steampunk art with real-world quantum technology and thermodynamics (the science of energy). To learn more, navigate through the pages in the menu above. Afterward, please share your reactions by signing our virtual guestbook [hyperlink] and posting with the hashtag #quantadrive on social media!

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

We can add selected publications below via `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render the [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to our social media connections can go at the bottom. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. We can add Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
