This tabletop version of Captain Okoli’s Magnificent Steampunk Quantum Engine offers a taste of the full-scale sculpture that our team aims to build. The full-size version can have a diameter of up to eight feet and can live indoors or outdoors. If you’re interested in commissioning or supporting the large-scale sculpture, please get in touch! Get in touch also if you’d like to display the Captain Okoli’s Magnificent Steampunk Quantum Engine at an event as an artistic centerpiece or an educational tool. 

For the meantime, please share your thoughts and photos on social media, using the #qsteamengine hashtag! Also, we’d be grateful if you jotted down your reactions in our virtual guestbook [hyperlink].
