The tabletop Quantadrive offers a taste of the full-scale sculpture that our
team aims to build. The full-size version can have a diameter of up to eight
feet and can live indoors or outdoors. If you’re interested in commissioning
or otherwise supporting the large-scale sculpture, please get in touch! Get
in touch also if you’d like to display the Quantadrive at an event as an
artistic centerpiece or an educational tool.

Will add the rest of the description.
