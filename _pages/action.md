Press the switch at the base of the statue (a brass antique from the early
1900s). The sculpture will light up in an artistic rendering of a heat-engine
cycle. As mentioned on the “Components” page, hyperlink many engines
operate by undergoing engine cycles. An engine cycle is a sequence of
strokes, or steps. Many famous engine cycles have two or four strokes
each. Examples include the Otto cycle, which many car engines undergo,
and the Carnot cycle, designed to achieve the greatest efficiency possible
(for any engine that interacts with just a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir).
During a stroke, the engine may exchange heat with its hot reservoir or
cold reservoir. Also, thermodynamic properties of the engine might change.
For example, if the engine consists essentially of a classical gas (as do
many car engines), its pressure or volume might vary.

Will add the rest of the description.
