__Nicole Yunger Halpern__ is a theoretical quantum physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She coined the term “quantum steampunk” for her research, which blends Victorian-era thermodynamics with cutting-edge quantum information science. Nicole co-leads the [Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub](https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/), as well as leading a [research group](https://quantumsteampunk.umiacs.io/) at the University of Maryland. She earned her PhD at Caltech, winning the international Ilya Prigogine Prize for a thermodynamics thesis. She received the International Quantum Technology Emerging Researcher Award as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. Other accolades include the US ASPIRE Prize and inclusion in the Science News “Ten to Watch” list of early- and mid-career scientists. Her book, _[Quantum Steampunk: The Physics of Yesterday’s Tomorrow](https://quantumsteampunk.umiacs.io/book/)_, won the PROSE Award for popular science and mathematics.
