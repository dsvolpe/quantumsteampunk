Several interconnected ideas informed the conception and design of the Quantadrive. First, steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction; itâ€™s permeated literature, film, art, and handicraft. In steampunk works, 19th- century settings feature futuristic technologies. Think of the classics The Time Machine and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, the bestselling book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, and the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen that stars Sean Connery. Dirigibles, automata, and steam-powered computers infiltrate Victorian London; the American Wild, Wild West; a newly liberated Haiti; and more. The past mingles with the future, creating an aura of adventure and innovation.
