__Spiros Michalakis__ is a mathematical physicist and the manager of outreach at Caltech's Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM). His work on the Quantum Hall Effect, with Microsoft’s Matthew Hastings, helped resolve one of thirteen significant open problems in mathematical physics. As the science consultant for Marvel’s _Ant-Man_ and _Ant-Man and the Wasp_, Spiros introduced the "quantum realm" into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, igniting a global fascination with concepts such as quantum superpositions and entanglement. As the U.S. representative for World Quantum Day, Spiros presented the first-ever quantum-science category on the popular game show “Jeopardy!” For IQIM outreach, he helped produce “The PHD Movie 2”; worked with Google and Mojang to bring quantum physics into the popular Minecraft game; created the viral YouTube video “[Anyone Can Quantum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi0BzqV_b44)” (pitting Paul Rudd against Stephen Hawking in a quantum-chess match narrated by Keanu Reeves); and worked with Quantum Realm Games and Google Quantum AI, under Q12Education’s QuanTime initiative, to bring quantum physics to middle- and high-school students through activities centered on quantum games.
